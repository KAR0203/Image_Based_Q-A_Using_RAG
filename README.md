# 🧠 Image-Based Q&A Using RAG

## 📌 Overview

This project implements an **Image-Based Question Answering** system using the concept of **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**. The model can interpret an image, generate a descriptive caption, and answer user questions based on the image content.

## 🛠 Technologies Used

| Task                    | Technology / Library                                 |
|-------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| Image Captioning        | `BLIP-2` (via Hugging Face Transformers)             |
| Language Modeling       | `AutoModelForCausalLM` (e.g., GPT-style LLMs)        |
| Question Embedding (optional) | `sentence-transformers`                        |
| Tokenization            | `AutoTokenizer`                                      |
| Transformer Integration | `transformers` by Hugging Face                      |
| Environment             | Google Colab (Python 3)                              |

## 🚀 How It Works

1. **Upload Image**: A `.jpg` or `.png` image is uploaded.
2. **Caption Generation**: BLIP-2 generates a caption that describes the image.
3. **User Input**: User types a question about the image.
4. **Answer Generation**: A language model generates an answer based on the caption + question.

## 🔄 Example Flow

| Step       | Output                                      |
|------------|---------------------------------------------|
| 🖼 Image     | A cat sitting on a laptop                  |
| 📝 Caption  | "A grey cat sitting on a laptop keyboard." |
| ❓ Question | "What is the cat sitting on?"               |
| 🤖 Answer   | "The cat is sitting on a laptop keyboard." |
